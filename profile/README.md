## Welcome to the Battery Data Alliance! 👋

We are building sustainable open source software, best practices, and delivering standards for the battery industry.

## About Us
The LF Energy Battery Data Alliance (BDA) was created to bring battery companies together to reduce the repeat work done in the battery industry. 

Battery data is core to creating a decarbonized economy and power systems, yet companies waste tremendous amounts of time implementing battery data schemas, integrations/conversions, typical calculations, etc. 

BDA believes that open source tools should exist to enable researchers and engineers to focus on bringing more innovative solutions to market rather than each organization duplicating the same work.

## Goals:
- Standardization: Bring cohesion to the battery software sector by establishing universally accepted practices, schemas, and configuration protocols.
- Efficiency: Streamline the process of data collection, conversion, and testing equipment configuration to eliminate redundancy and facilitate smoother workflows.
- Open-Source Collaboration: Unite battery software developers and engineers in an environment where open-source resources can be curated, shared, and evolved to benefit the entire industry.

## Objectives:
- Design: Launch a comprehensive battery data catalog, aggregating all open-source data, thus simplifying the cell selection process for manufacturers.
- Testing: Establish an automated and standardized approach to configuring the myriad cyclers in the market, while bridging the gap between existing testing standards and their execution.
- Manufacturing: Develop a consistent battery data schema and provide open-source tools for efficient data conversion, easing the collaborative process among manufacturers.
- Telemetry: Venture into the untapped realm of battery telemetry with an open-source perspective, aiming to revolutionize data collection at scale.
